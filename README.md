Amazon Clone 🛒

Amazon Clone: My Full Stack learning playground! Built with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript to master the fundamentals. 🧠 I'm recreating the giant from scratch to understand how the frontend connects to the backend logic. It’s a work in progress, just me figuring out how the web works! 🚧💻

🛒 Project Amazon: Learning by Doing

Welcome to my version of Amazon! I started this project because I realized the best way to learn Full Stack Development isn't just watching videos—it's building something huge and slightly intimidating. Here is the scoop:

🧠 Why Amazon?

It has everything a developer needs to learn—user accounts, dynamic product lists, search features, and shopping carts. It’s basically the ultimate "final boss" for a student developer like me to practice on.

🛠️ The Tech Stack

I am purposefully sticking to the core fundamental technologies to build a rock-solid foundation before relying too heavily on frameworks:

HTML5: For structuring the layout and semantics of the application.

CSS3: For styling, grid systems, and making sure the design is responsive.

JavaScript: For handling all the logic, interactivity, and connecting the different parts of the stack together.

⚡ What I'm Learning

I am using this project to master the "Full Stack" connection. Specifically:

Frontend: Learning how to manage complex state (like keeping items in the cart) and making the UI look professional on all screen sizes.

Backend & Logic: Figuring out how to structure data and handle requests using JavaScript to make the app actually functional.

Database Concepts: Understanding how to structure data for products and users so it can be fetched quickly.

🎥 Credits & Inspiration

A huge shoutout to SuperSimple Dev! 🙌

This project was built following their comprehensive JavaScript course. It’s been a massive help in understanding the logic behind e-commerce functionality.

Note: While I followed the tutorial, I'm actively tweaking the code and adding my own experiments to understand the concepts better.
